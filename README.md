# smolbot
A discord bot for a private discord server with friends. 

## Preamble
This is just a little project where I'm doing my first steps in NodeJS (or rather DiscordJS) development. 
Nothing serious and more of a fun way to pass my time when I'm not at work.

## About
As written in the first sentence of this Readme file, this is a discord bot I'm developing for the private server a friend of mine made.
This bot's purpose is to allow users to play with fun commands â€“ so nothing too crazy.

## To-dos
Here are the things I still have to do:
* Make this bot functional
* Create some super funny commands
* Convince my friend to add this bot to their server
